### HTTP Methods ->
    GET
    POST
    PUT
    PATCH
    DELETE

### GET ->
    When you want to get some data from the server then you will do GET request.

### POST ->
    When you want to send and mutate some data in server then you will do POST request.
    Whenever we fill a form and click on submit, then it will make POST request.

### PUT ->
    PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result.

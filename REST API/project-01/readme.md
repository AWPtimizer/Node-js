Types of status codes ->
Informational responses (100 – 199)
Successful responses (200 – 299)
Redirection messages (300 – 399)
Client error responses (400 – 499)
Server error responses (500 – 599)

It's a good practice to add 201 Status code if ->
 The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. This is typically the response sent after<b> POST </b>requests, or some <b> PUT </b> requests.
